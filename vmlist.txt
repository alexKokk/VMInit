# Main VM List used by VMInit.
#
# VMs that are to be processed by the VMInit script must added here.
# Commented lines are denoted by the hash character at the beginning.
#
# VMs are denoted by their names, one line each.
#
# For example, if root has a VM named Redhat1, then you must type:
#
# Redhat1
#
# If specific VMs are owned by specific users, then please put a double colon (::) and add their names right after it.
# For example:
# If the VM named Redhat2 is owned by user JohnDoe, then this is what should be entered:
#
# Redhat2::JohnDoe
#
# If a username isn't supplied, then it defaults to root.
